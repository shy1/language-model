"To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention \
her any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of \
her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. \
All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise \
but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning \
and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have \
placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, \
save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--\
11 excellent for drawing the veil from menâ€™s motives and actions. But for the \
trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely \
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw \
a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack \
in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong \
emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and \
that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory."
